Okay, my first actual post. Here goes nothing... This week was, honestly, a bit of a whirlwind.

## WSL Issues

Monday morning I booted up my computer, made my coffee, and sat down to start my workday. Open Microsoft Terminal to launch my WSL environment, and run in to a "cannot find that exe" error. Oh no.

Some solid "Google-fu" later and I discover the solution is to unmount the installed distribution, download the update, and use the new image. Which worked - I was back in WSL and ready to code! Unfortunately, my files weren't.

I'm assuming it was the unmounting process, but somewhere along the way I lost all of the files within the WSL partition. All my installed software, my cloned repositories, **everything**. I was able to get things back up and running, but that involved reinstalling all of my tooling and re-configuring all of my local `.env` files for my projects. It took some time, even with only focusing on the main projects I actively work on. Thankfully I have somewhat [extensive notes](https://nhcarrigan.com/notes) for setting up a new environment. Big thank you to past me, who documented all of that for the time I choose to upgrade my machine (not anticipating something like this).

## Game Development

A friend of mine started a game jam in her server, so I decided to [whip up a quick game](https://nhcarrigan.itch.io/ruus-goblin-quest) for the event. This was the inspiration I needed to start getting back in to game development, and I picked up where I left off on the [Beccalia](https://www.beccalia.com) series.

Unfortunately, where I left off was still the planning stages. I've made some solid progress, but my goodness is it mentally draining. I know that having everything properly laid out is going to make the actual development process much smoother (and result in a better product overall), but it's definitely quite tedious at times. With any luck, I can get the planning completed this weekend and be ready to start building.

## Community News

Some big community news this week - I found out I was selected to participate in the [EddieHub Ambassador programme](https://www.eddiehub.org/). For those who do not know, EddieHub is a community of developers focused on creating a safe and inclusive space to collaborate on open source work. If you are interested in open source, regardless of where you are at in your journey, this community will have a place for you. I am excited to see what this partnership brings, and as a member of the initial selection wave, eager to help shape the programme for future Ambassadors.

In other community news, I overhauled my own [discord server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com) - I found that many new members were unsure of the purpose of the community, so I attempted a bit of a restructuring to help guide folks to a better understanding. So far, it seems to have been effective, and we are nearly at the 500 member mark (a milestone which will unlock better levels of analytics for the server).

## Other Stuff

Work continues to go well. My role at [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) is as enjoyable as it was when I first started. I'm in the process of negotiating some part time work with another client, which would significantly help my financial goals. I'm also settling in well to my community management roles with [Streamcord](https://streamcord.io) and [TweetShift](https://tweetshift.com). Assuming this additional client pans out, I'll probably be at my limit for the amount of work I can take on.

I've been on an art kick lately, ordering commissions of myself - there's something satisfying about the dopamine kick from receiving new art, and my gallery page is starting to fill out nicely. I'd order more, but I do need to mind the budget on that. Maybe another round of commissions next month. Would you like to [sponsor one](https://donate.nhcarrigan.com)?

I think that covers everything I have to share for the week. Thanks for reading, and we'll see you next time!

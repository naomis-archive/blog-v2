I go back and forth a lot on whether or not I want a blog, so it’s entirely possible that this ends up getting deleted… But for now, here it is!</p>\n<p>My goal with this blog is to post an update every weekend with general thoughts about how my week went. These thoughts will be some development related stuff, but probably mostly personal stuff. Honestly not sure yet - we’ll see how this unfolds.</p>\n<p>Anyway, for more real time updates (and more permanent sources), take a look at my socials below!</p>\n<h2>Socials</h2>\n<p>The best place to get real time updates is definitely my <a href=\"https://chat.nhcarrigan.com\">Discord server</a> - I’ve got all sorts of systems in there to show what I’m working on.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nhcarrigan\">Twitter</a> is also a good place to go, though that’s less development related and more random.</p>\n<p>You can check out the rest of my socials available on my <a href=\"https://www.nhcarrigan.com\">homepage</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome to my Blog!","date":"April 15, 2022","description":"This blog is just my general ramblings, I suppose."}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022/April/2022-04-16/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Broken Development Environment"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2cc84f8b-d02a-565d-a92a-bbf3ebfa3a13","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"744c72af-a798-571c-8dfa-82d37b0006eb"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3008643779"]}

I shipped two products and they both worked!</p>\n<h2>Client Work</h2>\n<p>I built and launched a new level system and membership gating system for Rythm this week. It is absolutely wild that I build bots for a community of 300,000 people, and that they work! I’ve been developing things for two years, and I still can’t wrap my head around the idea that I’m good enough to get paid for it. It’s so mind blowing. People pay me for my code. What???</p>\n<p>Over at Sema, we launched the developer rubric Discord bot. I, personally, didn’t write the code for this, but I hope that my support is what helped Vyom build the product. I did, however, manage our first moderator interview today! It went quite well, but is still only an early step in our efforts to build a community. One step at a time, though!</p>\n<p>At freeCodeCamp, we moved our translation efforts/discussion over to Discord. This required some extra focus on my end, so that I could help structure the new community direction and get everything ready. It was a nice chance to put my community building skills to work, and I like to think it went well. I suppose time will tell!</p>\n<p>As I wrote this post (and took a nap), I received another client project (to maybe start on Monday). The work never ends!</p>\n<h2>Personal Stuff</h2>\n<p>I’ve been so busy that I really haven’t had any time for personal stuff. I do know I’ve been struggling a bit, but it’s nothing I can’t handle. For now, I think I’ll end this blog post and get some more rest!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Highly Productive!","date":"June 18, 2022","description":"I delivered two projects this week!"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022/June/2022-06-11/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"This Was a Good Week!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022/July/2022-07-02/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Busy Busy Busy"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1f92effa-5617-51b8-b9e4-13d4aa6e4048","previousPostId":"93938c6c-cb67-5562-9f50-afb1b441cec0","nextPostId":"e06291d6-9245-5390-b206-279e46f78781"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3008643779"]}

So much so that I forgot to make Saturday’s blog post. So here it is, albeit a few days late…</p>\n<h2>New Website</h2>\n<p>I completely revamped my home page last weekend. While I had been using basic HTML and CSS to minimise the page load and keep things lean, my new vision required the use of Angular to better control the content and flow. What was a page explaining who I am and the work I do is now completely redesigned to feel like an old-school text adventure game. It was a lot of fun to write and design the content, and I’m quite proud of how it turned out.</p>\n<p>This, of course, ended up inspiring me to get back to working on my <em>actual</em> game.</p>\n<h2>Game Development</h2>\n<p>I was able to carve out some time to work on the next instalment of the Beccalia series. I made some solid progress over the weekend, getting the initial introduction scene in place and adding a point for the player to choose which path to follow. I also got the first couple scenes of Becca’s prologue in place.</p>\n<p>Having spent so much time planning out the story and building data tables for all of the game data, I had forgotten just how time consuming actually <em>building</em> the game was. I’d hoped to ship this game in time for summer, but given that it’s already May I’m not sure how feasible that is. This may end up having to be an end of the year release. But with any luck, this one being a paid game might generate some revenue.</p>\n<h2>Other Work</h2>\n<p>I’m managing to keep up with my client work quite well. Despite being quite busy, I have managed not to fall behind on anything (at least, not the client work). Even managed to ship an MVP for a project.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, some of my personal projects are falling a bit by the wayside. Rosalia Nightsong, especially - she was meant to be a discord bot that allowed you to play an RPG game, but that ended up stalling out hard and she’s only got some very basic features.</p>\n<h2>Social Life</h2>\n<p>My social life has also been on the back burner. I’ve been less active in a lot of the communities I’m in, focusing on all of the work I have to do instead. I’ve been slow to respond to people who message me. I can only hope folks understand that it’s nothing personal, I’m just focusing on the grind.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that’s all for this post!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Third Post and I'm Already Late","date":"May 03, 2022","description":"I suppose that's indicative of how things have been going."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022/April/2022-04-23/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Insomnia, Client Work, and a Never-Ending Week"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022/May/2022-05-08/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Crash and Burn(out)"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ae7c35ad-0ece-56e0-b982-b10bf4554b91","previousPostId":"d6f7c55d-9f43-5517-95cc-f77f03b11579","nextPostId":"6e44e3a8-922e-5365-9b97-fcedb4af1ca0"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3008643779"]}
